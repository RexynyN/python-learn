She’s not expected to participate in P.E., of course, and is even allowed to suffer morning and school-wide assemblies in the shade, alone, as a precaution against anemia or something. Though we’ve been in the same class my first, my second, and this, my third and final year of high school, I’ve never once seen her engaged in any sort of vigorous activity. She’s a regular at the nurse’s room, and she arrives late, leaves early, or simply doesn’t show up to school because she has to visit her primary care hospital, time and again. To the point where it’s rumored in jest that she lives there.\n",

You could say earnestly. That phrase and its connotations aptly describe Senjogahara, I agree.\n",

Maybe she doesn’t care as long as there are words in it, maybe she has some sort of clear standard.\n",

      "     I have yet to witness Senjogahara exchanging words with someone─the shrewd take might be that her constant reading is a behavior intended to tell you not to speak to her because she is reading, a way of building walls around herself. In fact, I’ve sat in the same classroom as her for two years and change, and can state with certainty that I’ve never spoken a word to her in that time. I can and do. Senjogahara’s voice is synonymous, for me, with the reedy “I don’t know” that she utters like a catchphrase whenever a teacher calls on her in class (whether or not it’s a question she clearly knows the answer to, she only ever replies, “I don’t know”). Schools are strange places where people without friends routinely form a sort of community (or a colony) of people without friends (myself included, until last year), but Senjogahara seems to be exempt from this rule too. Of course, it’s not like she’s getting bullied, either. She isn’t being persecuted or avoided in any deep, or light, way as far as I can tell. Like that’s her natural place to be, with a cool face, Senjogahara goes on reading in one corner of the classroom. She goes on building walls around herself.\n",

Whether you love your mother or not, whether you get along with your mother or not, the day is Mother’s Day for every Japanese person alike. I want to say that Mother’s Day originated in America. In that sense, it may be best to consider it a kind of event, like Japan does Christmas, Halloween, Valentine’s Day, and the like. But in any case, of all three hundred and sixty-five days of the year, this day, May fourteenth, was the one where more carnations were sold than any other, and when coupons promising the delivery of back rubs, chores, and so on were trading hands in homes across the country. Well, I don’t really know if those kinds of customs are still being observed, but I am sure that May fourteenth was indeed Mother’s Day this year.\n",

Or maybe, I wondered, elementary schoolers these days no longer defaulted to baseball, then soccer, when they wanted to go have fun.

A large open space separated my bench from someone at a metal sign at the edge of the park─a lone grade schooler who was looking at a residential map of the area. The child’s back was facing me, so I had no idea what he or she was like, but the large backpack the kid carried was notable. My heart warmed for a moment like I’d found a new buddy, but the grade schooler spent a while looking at the map, then ran off, as if remembering something. And then I was alone.\n",

Unbefitting of a grade schooler, her kick had beautiful form as if a rod ran through her spine keeping it perfectly straight. Sadly, there’s something of a height gap between elementary school and high school students, and it proved  insurmountable. It might have turned out differently had she caught me square in the face, but her high kick only made it up to my armpit. That isn’t to say that the tip of her shoe hitting me there didn’t do any damage, but the pain was bearable. Immediately after her foot hit me, I used my arms to grab her around her ankle and calf.\n",

If this were judo, you’d call it a hip throw. It’s against the rule to grab your opponent’s leg like that in judo, but unfortunately for her, this was real combat, not some match. As soon as her body left the ground, I was treated to a glimpse of the contents of her skirt, at a fairly racy angle, but not being a pedophile I wasn’t distracted one bit. I simply tossed her over my shoulder.\n",

I was growing it out for a reason─which meant that even Hachikuji’s short fingers had no problem grabbing hold of it. Pain shot through my scalp and shocked my hand into letting go of Hachikuji’s calf.\n",

She wasn’t able to convey her accustomed amount of force because her feet were off the ground. Our difference in age and experience showed.

Moreover, while the character “yoi” on its own means the time around dusk, that is to say twilight, the hour when you encounter the weird, the character “ma,” which usually means “true,” acts as a negative prefix in this instance, so that the archaic term “mayoi” signifies the middle of the night, two in the morning to be precise─yes, the so-called dead of night.

Nothing eventful about it, as supreme a weekday as you could get. I had a light breakfast and headed to school. Not on my mountain bike, but on my granny bike.

I will be going into details, so if any of you are reading this afterword before the main text, I’m sorry, but I suggest that you stop and come back after you’ve read the whole thing. Okay, what I felt like writing was just that stock introduction, and I won’t actually be giving any commentary, but when you think about it, authors giving something like commentary on their own stories is no simple affair. People can’t express their thoughts a hundred percent, and what does get expressed isn’t going to make it across a hundred percent; in practice, you’re at sixty percent for each if things go well, which would mean the audience of a work gets only thirty-six percent of what the author is thinking. The other sixty-four percent is made up of misunderstandings, so you often can’t agree with more than half of what’s being said when you read an author’s own commentary. Like, hold on, that’s what he was thinking? It’s the so-called difficulty of communicating, but it’s also an absolute fact that those misunderstandings spice things up in a good way. For example, when I suggest a book I love to people, I try to give an immersive account of a scene that moved me, but sometimes, upon rereading the book, I find out that the scene isn’t there. At the end of the day, humans are unreliable creatures, so when we feel something, more than half of it is a misunderstanding, but maybe you shouldn’t interpret it in a pessimistic way and instead look at it as the author or the story having the power to make you misunderstand. If you are a reader, I’m sure you’ve experienced looking back at a book that had an impact on you and realizing that it actually wasn’t that big of a deal after all; and recommending a book that moved you in your teens to current teens, promising them that they’ll love it, and not getting a great reaction, is something we all get a taste of. That’s thanks to audience misunderstanding, or mental images if you want to put a better spin on it, and maybe instead of feeling let down, you ought to be giving thanks for the dreams the work allowed you to see. To add to that, there are those cases where whatever scene that wasn’t there upon rereading crops up in a different book, but that’s just my own sucky memory, for which no author or story is to be held responsible.\n",
